            <p>The image above is centered and round because I use display: block and margin: 0 auto along with
                border-radiuis: 50%. Images are normally inline elements and can't be centered with margin since it
                doesn't have a width. Once we display it as a block level element, it gets a width and can be centered
                with the margin. </p>

            <p>Right-click this page and view the source of it. After viewing the source, look for the link tag in the
                head of the HTML. Click on the link for the CSS file and you'll find more information related to the
                styles on this page and how they were added. This page is just a basic demonstration of how CSS can be
                applied to add styles to a page. It has two columns of content along with some floated items throughout
                the page. It also demonstrates how to center items and use padding/margin to provide spacing between
                elements.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150x150" alt="dummy image from placeholder.com">
                <p>The image to the left of this paragraph has been floated. Since it's floated, the text here will flow
                    around it. Being that this content is in a div with a class of "row", it won't move up or down. I've
                    added margin to the right of the image to give it space from the text. This div has been given
                    padding to allow there to be space between the content and the edge of our container. </p>
            </div>
            <p>The "Contact Us" div inside of the div with a class of aside (to the left of this paragraph) has been
                given a border to wrap all of the content. I've given the h3 no margin so that it is right against the
                container. The form is right against the container and I gave it some padding so that the form elements
                weren't against the edge of the container. Each input has a bottom margin to provide space betwen
                inputs. Lastly, the entire contact div is give margin on the bottom so that there is space between it
                and the footer.</p>
